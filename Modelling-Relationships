// Trade off between query performance and consistency
1st Approach : Using References (Normalaization) => consistency
ex: 

let author = {
    name: 'Mosh'
}

let course = {
    author: ObjectId('.....')
}

2nd Approach : Embeded Documents (Denormalization) => Performance 
ex: 

let course = {
    author : {
        name : 'Mosh',
        .....
    }
}

3rd Approach: Hybrid => Useful when want to take snapshot data
ex: 

let author = {
    name: 'Mosh',
    // 50 other properties
}

let course = {
    author : {
        id: 'ref',
        name : 'Mosh'
    }
}
